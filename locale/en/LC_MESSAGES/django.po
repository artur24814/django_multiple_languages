"Warsaw traces its origins to a small fishing town in Masovia.\n"
"The city rose to prominence in the late 16th century,\n"
"when Sigismund III decided to move the Polish capital and his royal court "
"from Kraków.\n"
"Warsaw served as the de facto capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth "
"until 1795, and subsequently as the seat of Napoleon's Duchy of Warsaw.\n"
"The 19th century and its Industrial Revolution brought a demographic boom "
"which made it one of the largest and most densely-populated cities in "
"Europe.\n"
"Known then for its elegant architecture and boulevards, Warsaw was bombed "
"and besieged at the start of World War II in 1939.\n"
"Much of the historic city was destroyed and its diverse population decimated "
"by the Ghetto Uprising in 1943, the general Warsaw Uprising in 1944 and "
"systematic razing.\n"
